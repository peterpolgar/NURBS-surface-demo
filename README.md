# NURBS surface demo built with p5.js
This is a NURBS surface demonstration on a webpage: https://peterpolgar.github.io/NURBS-surface-demo

Programmed in an iterative way instead of recursion.

surface.js contains some explanatory comments to better understanding the code.

surface.min.js is the hosted version which is the minified form of surface.js.
