# NURBS surface demo built with p5.js
This is a NURBS surface demonstration on a webpage: https://peterpolgar.github.io/NURBS-surface-demo

Programmed in an iterative way instead of recursion.

surface.js and surface_drag.js (mouse controlled) contain some explanatory comments to better understanding the code.

surface_drag.min.js is the hosted version which is the minified form of surface_drag.js.
